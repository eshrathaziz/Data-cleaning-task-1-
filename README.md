Cleaned Netflix Movies Dataset — processed and ready for analysis. Includes standardized column names, removed duplicates, and fixed missing values.
The Netflix Data Cleaning Project provides a refined version of a Netflix movies dataset that has been processed for accuracy, consistency, and usability. Raw datasets often include duplicates, missing values, and irregular formatting, which can interfere with meaningful analysis. In this project, the data has been thoroughly cleaned by removing duplicate records, addressing missing values, and standardizing column names to follow a uniform structure. The resulting dataset focuses only on relevant movie details, ensuring that it is reliable and ready for direct use.

This cleaned dataset can serve multiple purposes: it enables exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in Netflix’s movie catalog, supports data visualization projects that highlight content patterns, and provides a solid foundation for machine learning workflows by reducing the need for extensive preprocessing. In addition, it can be used in academic and educational settings as a practical example of data cleaning and preparation techniques. By publishing this dataset, the project aims to make analysis faster and more reliable for data scientists, researchers, and students alike.
